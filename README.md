## Optimal Crop Watering System for precision Agriculture with emphasis to weather conditions
This project is an IoT-based smart irrigation solution designed to optimize water usage in agriculture by integrating real-time weather conditions and crop-specific data. The system helps farmers manage water resources efficiently, enhancing crop yields while conserving water.

## Requirements
* Soil Moisture Sensor: Continuously measures soil moisture levels to determine when crops need watering.
* DHT11 Sensor: Tracks ambient temperature and humidity to adjust watering cycles based on weather conditions.
* Pump and DC Motor: Automatically regulate water flow based on soil moisture and weather data.
* Relay: Controls the activation of the pump and motor to initiate or stop watering as needed.
* Buzzer: Alerts the user of any system anomalies or when watering is triggered.
* LCD Display: Provides real-time feedback on the systemâ€™s status, including sensor readings and water flow status.
* NodeMCU 8266: Connects the system to the internet, allowing remote monitoring and control.
* Arduino Software: Powers the microcontroller, managing the interaction between sensors, actuators, and the control logic.

## Key Features
1. Real-time Monitoring:
- Displays live data on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture through a user-friendly web interface.
- Hosted on a secure HTTPS server, accessible from any web-enabled device.
2. Graphical Data Visualization:
- Provides real-time graphs showing temperature and humidity trends, helping users track environmental changes over time.
3. Automated Watering:
- Based on real-time soil moisture and weather data, the system can automatically start or stop watering, ensuring optimal conditions for the crops.
4.Machine Learning Integration:
- The system uses a Flask-based machine learning framework to predict future watering needs by analyzing historical data.
- This predictive model helps optimize the next watering cycle for specific crops, improving water usage efficiency and preventing over/underwatering.
5.User-Friendly Interface:
- Simple web pages display all sensor data, status updates, and historical graphs, making the system accessible even for non-technical users.

## Benefits
* Precision Agriculture: By adjusting the watering schedule based on real-time weather and soil conditions, the system ensures that crops receive the optimal amount of water.
* Water Conservation: Reduces water wastage by delivering water only when needed, based on data-driven decisions.
* Scalability: The system can be adapted to different crop types and farm sizes by adjusting sensor placement and control algorithms.

## Overview
This system helps farmers and local gardeners to implement precision agriculture practices, reducing water wastage and optimizing crop health with minimal effort.
